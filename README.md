# the Labyrinth
- Try to get through the labyrinth, becoming more and more complex with each level! 
- It's a desktop screen size game, mobile version is in progress.
- Live-demo at: https://labyrinth-hyperbola88.web.app

## Technologies Used
- Html
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Matter.js as a 2D physics engine


## Features
- labyrinth is built randomly every time around randomly chosen cell by moving to a randomly chosen neighbour cell (there's a lot of randomicity going on here)
- each labyrinth allways has only one solution
- the algorithm for constriction is based on 3 2-level arrays: array of cells, arraay of horizontal cell walls, array of vertical cell walls
- 2D physic adds some fun!


## Usage
It is a fun project practice array methods and algorithms :)
